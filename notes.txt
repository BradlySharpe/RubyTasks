git:
  GitPush without credentials
    git config remote.origin.url https://brad7928:{PASSWORD}@github.com/brad7928/{REPO}.git
  Remove origin/HEAD -> origin/master branch
    git remote set-head origin -d

Create new project
  rails new { project name } -T
    (-T don't create tests, uses TestUnit by default, most prefer to use rspec)

Edit Gemfile and add the following in the test and development group
  gem 'rspec-rails' # Testing
  gem 'capybara' # Automated user testing
  gem 'guard-rspec' # Automatically run tests

Run bundle install to install the new gems

See what generators are available by typing `rails generator`
  Should show rspec:install

Run `rails g rspec:install` to set up rspec
  creates .rspec, /spec

Run `guard init rspec` to initialise guard

Test by running `guard` to automatically run tests

Install rb-fsevent gem `gem install rb-fsevent`, don't know why?
  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13944398/what-does-rb-fsevent-do

Create test
  `rails g integration_test tasks`
    Creates a new file in /spec/requests/tasks_spec.rb

Run test with `guard`, test will fail

Remove code between method and path in tasks_spec.rb
  Replace with
    it "display some tasks" do
      visit tasks_path
    end

Add `resources :tasks` to /config/routes.rb
  Run `rake routes` to check that routes have been created (should be 8)

Guard will still fail as Tasks controller doesn't exists
  create it - `rails g controller Tasks index` - creates it with and index view
  Controllers usually named plural,
  Models usually named singular

Run rails server (should work now)
  `rails server -b 192.168.1.200 -p 3000`

/public contains static files

Add default route
  in /config/routes.rb add
    root :to => 'controller#action' - the controller and action must be lowercase

Create a model
  `rails g model Task task:string` - Model name is singular, PK is created automatically

Migrate/Create the database
  `rake db:migrate`
